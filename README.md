==========================================================================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/nasa/SMCPy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/nasa/SMCPy) &nbsp;[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/nasa/SMCPy/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/nasa/SMCPy?branch=master)

Python module for uncertainty quantification using a parallel sequential Monte
Carlo sampler.

To operate the code, the user supplies a computational model built in Python
3+, defines prior distributions for each of the model parameters to be
estimated, and provides data to be used for calibration. SMC sampling can then
be conducted with ease through instantiation of the SMCSampler class and a call
to the sample() method. The output of this process is an approximation of the
parameter posterior probability distribution conditional on the data provided.

This software was funded by and developed under the High Performance Computing
Incubator (HPCI) at NASA Langley Research Center.

## Example Usage

```python
import numpy as np

from scipy.stats import uniform

from spring_mass_model import SpringMassModel
from smcpy.utils.plotter import plot_pairwise
from smcpy import SMCSampler, VectorMCMC, VectorMCMCKernel


# Initialize model
state0 = [0., 0.]  # initial conditions
measure_t_grid = np.arange(0., 5., 0.2)  # time
model = SpringMassModel(state0, measure_t_grid)

# Load data
std_dev = 0.5
displacement_data = np.genfromtxt('noisy_data.txt')

# Define prior distributions & MCMC kernel
priors = [uniform(0, 10), uniform(0, 10)]
vector_mcmc = VectorMCMC(model.evaluate, displacement_data, priors, std_dev)
mcmc_kernel = VectorMCMCKernel(vector_mcmc, param_order=('K', 'g'))

# SMC sampling
smc = SMCSampler(mcmc_kernel)
step_list, mll_list = smc.sample(num_particles=500,
                                 num_mcmc_samples=5,
                                 phi_sequence=np.linspace(0, 1, 20),
                                 ess_threshold=0.8,
                                 progress_bar=True)

# Display results
print(f'parameter means = {step_list[-1].compute_mean()}')

plot_pairwise(step_list[-1].params, step_list[-1].weights, save=True,
              param_labels=['K', 'g'])
```

The above code produces probabilistic estimates of K, the spring stiffness divided by mass, and g, the gravitational constant on an unknown planet. These estimates are in the form of weighted particles and can be visualized by plotting the pairwise weights as shown below. The mean of each parameter is marked by the dashed red line. The true values for this example were K = 1.67 and g = 4.62. More details can be found in the spring mass example (smcpy/examples/spring_mass/). To run this model in parallel using MPI, the MCMC kernel just needs to be built
with the ParallelMCMC class in place of VectorMCMC. More details can be found in the mpi example (smcpy/examples/mpi_example/).
